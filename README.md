Grading System

This is a simple Python program for students to check their grade.
The user is asked to enter marks between 0 and 100.
The program then shows the grade based on the marks:

- A: 75 - 100  
- B: 65 - 74  
- C: 55 - 64  
- S: 35 - 54  
- F: 0 - 34  

It also checks if the input is a number and in the correct range.
